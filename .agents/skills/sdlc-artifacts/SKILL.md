description: Manage change packets (`changes/<id>/`) and the root `intent.md`/`spec.md` baseline. Use when starting a product or a change, interrogating requirements, drafting or revising intent/spec/plan, preparing an owner approval, checking readiness, deciding whether implementation is authorized, or closing a change.

# SDLC Artifacts

The lifecycle rules are executable. `python3 scripts/repo.py status --change <id>` computes stage, freshness, approval and readiness, and blocks out-of-order, stale, or out-of-scope work. `changes/README.md` defines the model. This skill covers the judgment around it.

## Start a change

1. Pick an id (lowercase, digits, inner hyphens) and a kind from `changes/README.md`. A new product's first change is `product-init`.
2. From the commit the change starts from, run `python3 scripts/repo.py new <id> --kind <kind> --title "<summary>" --scope <pattern>...` (`--with-spec` adds an optional change-local `spec.md`). It writes `change.json` with `base` and `baseline` filled in, the plan skeleton, and copies of the root `intent.md`/`spec.md` the kind requires. Edit those copies, never the root files.
3. Keep `write_scope` to the paths the change needs, as narrow as practical. Without `repo.py new`, copy `changes/_template/` and the root files by hand and fill `base.commit` and the `baseline` digests printed by `status`.
4. Work on a branch named `change/<id>`, and use `Change-ID: <id>` in the pull request.

## Develop each artifact in order

- **Intent.** Interrogate ambiguity before drafting: problem, outcome, affected users and systems, constraints, scope, success criteria, and open questions. Any agent-specific interrogation interface is a convenience only. The intent describes the product and its outcomes. Do not put SDLC process goals in it: CI, pull request, verification, check registration, or closure criteria belong in the change's plan.
- **Spec.** Only after the intent is approved. Turn it into requirements, behavior, design, interfaces, data, dependencies, risks, and acceptance criteria. Carry unresolved questions forward instead of inventing answers.
- **Plan.** Only after the spec is approved, or inherited for kinds that carry no spec. Write it so an agent with no conversation history can implement it: files and components, order of work, proof, risks, and rollback. Challenge the riskiest step. Make each Order-of-work step name the files it changes and one command that proves it, so it can become a unit brief.

Never let a downstream artifact silently contradict an approved upstream one. Surface the conflict to the owner.

## Approval

- Only the human owner approves. Never infer approval from content, Git state, an earlier message, or your own judgment.
- When asked to record an approval the owner has explicitly given in this session, add a claim with the digest `status` prints for exactly the reviewed bytes. Editing the artifact afterwards makes the claim stale, which is intended.
- Describe local approval honestly: it is `unverified` process metadata. It detects staleness but does not prove identity.

## Implement

- Implement only when `status --change <id>` reports `readiness=ready`. Before that, change nothing outside the packet.
- Read the approved intent, spec and plan throughout. The plan is not the only authority.
- To delegate, follow the `change-execution` skill.
- If a material departure from the approved plan is needed, stop, revise `plan.md`, and get a fresh owner approval.
- Never revise an approved upstream artifact to make implementation easier or to justify code after the fact.

## Close

Follow the Lifecycle and Closure sections of `changes/README.md`:

1. Verify locally (`repo.py verify --change <id>`, and `--full`).
2. Merge accepted change-local `intent.md`/`spec.md` into the root and verify again.
3. Add a candidate `closure.json` citing only that existing local evidence. `status` then reports `stage=closed closure=candidate`.
4. Commit, push, and open the pull request. CI `summary` must pass on the closure-containing head. Record CI results in the pull request, never in the closure.
5. After human review and a squash merge, confirm `status` on the baseline branch reports `freshness=frozen closure=frozen`.

Fixes after the closure exists refresh its `evidence` in the same commit; see `changes/README.md`, Lifecycle. After merge the packet is frozen: never edit it again. Record follow-up work as a new change.
